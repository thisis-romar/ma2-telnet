# SK-14 — Group Creation & Bulk Operations


## Bulk Group Creation
Automate the creation of groups for many fixtures/channels using command sequences or macros:

```
Channel 111 ; Store Group "Flare" /merge
Fixture 101 ; Store Group "Flare" /merge
... (repeat for all)
```

## Macro Pattern for Bulk Grouping
For large shows, generate macros that loop over fixtures/channels and store them in groups. This can be scripted or generated by an agent.

## Integration
- Use with ma2-patch for patching/assignment
- Use with ma2-export-import for macro import/export

## Example
```
for (let i = 101; i <= 140; i++) {
  send(`Fixture ${i} ; Store Group "Flare" /merge`);
}
```
